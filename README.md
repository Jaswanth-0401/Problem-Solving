# Problem-Solving Repository

Welcome to my Problem-Solving repository! ðŸŽ‰

## About

I am here to upload the problems that I solve daily. This repository serves multiple purposes:
- **Consistency:** Ensures that I solve problems regularly and maintain a daily problem-solving habit.
- **Tracking Progress:** Helps me keep track of the problems I've solved over time.
- **Easy Access:** Allows me to revisit and review the algorithms and solutions Iâ€™ve learned and implemented.

## Structure

Each problem is organized in its own directory with the following structure:
- `problem-name/`
  - `README.md`: Contains the problem statement, approach, and explanation.
  - `solution.ext`: The solution code (e.g., `solution.py` for Python).
  - `test_cases.ext`: Any test cases or inputs/outputs used to verify the solution (optional).

## Algorithms

Whenever I learn a new algorithm, I upload it here to make it easier to access again in the future. This repository serves as a personal library of the algorithms and problem-solving techniques I have mastered.

## Contributions

This repository is primarily for personal use and self-improvement. However, if you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
